      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from CU Boulder with a degree in mathematics and am looking to broaden my skill set.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Scotts Valley, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing chess with friends and cooking.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Freelance Web Developer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver Colorado</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always enjoyed the few classes that I've taken that involve coding. These mostly involved puzzle solving, but web development seems fulfilling because I'd have a tangable result at the end.</p>
